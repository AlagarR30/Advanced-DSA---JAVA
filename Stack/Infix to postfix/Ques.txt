Write a program to convert and print a given valid parenthesized infix arithmetic expression to postfix expression. The expression consists of single character operands and +,-, *, / operators.
Constraints: only four operators used +, -, *, / .

Input format:
Input consists of a string which consists of infix expression.
The output consists of a postfix expression. If the input In-fix expression consists of an operator other than the Arithmetic operators mentioned above print "Invalid Input".
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.
[All text in bold corresponds to the input and the rest corresponds to output.] 

Output format:
The output consists of postfix expression.

Sample Input-Output 1:
Enter the infix expression
a+b
The postfix expression is
ab+
 
Sample Input-Output 2:

Enter the infix expression
a+b-(c*d)
The postfix expression is
